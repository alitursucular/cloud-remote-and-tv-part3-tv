## Cloud Remote and TV - Part 3 - TV

This fun project has three parts:

-   [Part 1 - Microservice](https://github.com/alitursucular/cloud-remote-and-tv-part1-microservice): Serverless functions with admin privileges interact with Firstore, and return data for the UI. It is powered using Express - Node.js and Firebase.
-   [Part 2 - Remote Controller](https://github.com/alitursucular/cloud-remote-and-tv-part2-remote): A digital remote controller which performs channel changes. It also displays the current channel number and invalidates the current channel query when a channel update is made. It is powered using React, Storybook, styled-components, react-query and Zustand.
-   Part 3 - TV: A single-page app that pretends to be a television. It displays the channel number and name on top of a channel image. It listens to server changes and updates the displayed image if there is a change. It is powered using React, Storybook, styled-components, react-query and Zustand.
